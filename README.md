Predicting a Monsters Challenge Rating

As a full fledged nerd, not only am I fluent in code, but also in Dungeons and 
Dragons (or DnD as all the "cool" kids say). I've played the game since I was
a young child of 5. I always loved looking through the pictures of the fiend 
folio and the monster manuals. As such when I usually think of ways machine 
learning can improve my life I often think of games such as DnD.

So I wondered, could a ML model predict the challenge rating of a monster in 
DnD? For those of you that are not fluent in DnD, a challenge rating is given
to each monster in DnD to help the Dungeon Master (the player of the game that 
is the main story teller and throws obstacles, monsters and other threats at the
other players). The image below shows the stat block for a dragon with the
challenge rating highlighted.

2. Collect data to answer your question via webscraping, APIs and/or combining
   several readily available dataset (i.e. kaggle, uci ML repo, etc.)
3. Clean / wrangle your data
4. Create features
5. Explore the data through EDA
6. Analyze the data with multiple machine learning approaches
7. Evaluate each model
8. Answer the original question
9. Understand and explain potential sources of bias in how your data/model
   answers your question of interest
