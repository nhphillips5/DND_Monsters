Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n**Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit."}],"spell_list":["https://api.open5e.com/spells/detect-magic/?format=json","https://api.open5e.com/spells/enlargereduce/?format=json","https://api.open5e.com/spells/tongues/?format=json","https://api.open5e.com/spells/conjure-elemental/?format=json","https://api.open5e.com/spells/gaseous-form/?format=json","https://api.open5e.com/spells/invisibility/?format=json","https://api.open5e.com/spells/major-image/?format=json","https://api.open5e.com/spells/plane-shift/?format=json","https://api.open5e.com/spells/wall-of-fire/?format=json"],"img_main":null,"document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"Systems Reference Document","document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal"},{"slug":"einherjar","name":"Einherjar","size":"Medium","type":"humanoid","subtype":"","group":null,"alignment":"chaotic neutral","armor_class":18,"armor_desc":"chain mail and shield","hit_points":119,"hit_dice":"14d8+56","speed":{"walk":30},"strength":19,"dexterity":16,"constitution":19,"intelligence":10,"wisdom":14,"charisma":11,"strength_save":null,"dexterity_save":null,"constitution_save":null,"intelligence_save":null,"wisdom_save":null,"charisma_save":null,"perception":5,"skills":{"intimidation":6,"perception":5},"damage_vulnerabilities":"","damage_resistances":"piercing weapons that are nonmagical","damage_immunities":"","condition_immunities":"","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., truesight 60 ft., passive Perception 15","languages":"Celestial, Common","challenge_rating":"7","actions":[{"name":"Multiattack","desc":"An einherjar makes three attacks with its Asgardian battleaxe or one with its handaxe."},{"name":"Asgardian Battleaxe","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
